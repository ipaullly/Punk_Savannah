# Savannah Punk

Ole Punctum has lost a livestock shipment while transporting the herd back from Io, on the Prairie belt ( after the efforts of terraforming moons orbiting jupiter and saturn ), after a bi-annual herding season. unfortunately a battle ship from a rival clan managed to take capture of three carrierships holding livestock.

use arrow keys to move Ole Punctum's flagship, Millenium Moran and the spacebar to blast oncoming big enemy ships, asteroid debris and sentient big five.
