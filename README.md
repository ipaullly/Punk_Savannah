# Savannah Punk

Ole Punctum has lost a livestock shipment while transporting the herd back from IO, on the pasture belt after a the herding season. unfortunately a battle ship from the rival clan managed to take capture three ships of sheep shipment (pun intended)

use arrow keys to move Ole Punctum's flagship, Millenium Moran and the spacebar to blast oncoming big enemy ships, asteroid debris and sentient big five.
